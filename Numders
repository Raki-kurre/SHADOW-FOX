# Question 2: Calculating the area of the pond and total water
# Given values
radius = 84  # in meters
pi = 3.14  # approximate value for Ï€
water_per_sqm = 1.4  # liters per square meter

# Calculating the pond's area and total water in liters
pond_area = pi * (radius ** 2)
total_water = int(pond_area * water_per_sqm)  # converting to integer

print("Pond Area (in square meters):", int(pond_area))

# Question 3: Calculating speed
distance = 490  # in meters
time_minutes = 7  # in minutes

# Converting time to seconds
time_seconds = time_minutes * 60

# Calculating speed in meters per second
speed_mps = int(distance / time_seconds)  # converting to integer

print("Speed (in meters per second):", speed_mps)
